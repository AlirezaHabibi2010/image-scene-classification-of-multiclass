# Image Scene Classification of Multiclass labels
The objective of this code is to classify the image using CNN with Keras. The dataset is a collection of images of Natural Scenes around the world.

This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host an Image classification Challenge.
This program is written for a competition of Kaggle and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification .

After the training, we achieved more than 90% accuracy. The trained model is saved in folder _saved_model_. 
## Dataset
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,  
'forest' -> 1,  
'glacier' -> 2,  
'mountain' -> 3,  
'sea' -> 4,  
'street' -> 5 }  
The Train, Test, and Prediction data is separated into different folders. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test, and 7k in Prediction.
